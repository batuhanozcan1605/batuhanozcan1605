The aim of the project is onboarding Web2 developers to Web3 easily.
The project is formed in the ETHGlobal AI Agent Hackathon in 9 days as POC.
My main role was frontend development for this project. I also have developed the basevenuewolf_sdk package to be able to use our project in development of other projects and a main screen for the 1-page game for demo purpose. Eventually, we have connected the sdk and the demo game succesfully via an API that is developed by my backend teammate.
